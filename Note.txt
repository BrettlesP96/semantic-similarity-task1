The similarities between "cat", "monkey", and "banana" are interesting because while "cat" and "monkey" are both animals, "banana" is a fruit. Despite this, the model is still able to establish semantic relationships between these words, recognizing that "cat" and "monkey" are more similar to each other than either is to "banana".

Example: Let's consider three new words - "car", "bicycle", and "Highway". We can expect the model to find that "car" and "bicycle" are more similar to each other as both are vehicles, while "Highway" is a related concept but not a vehicle itself.
